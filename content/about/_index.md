        * [CS186 / CS286](https://cs186berkeley.net/): Project TA for an class on databases and distributed systems. Wrote a multi-thousand line Database project suited for education in Java. 
        Project is still being used 5 years later to teach database design fundamentals for over 1000 students per semester. Topics taught include: B+ tree indices creation/maintenance, query optimization, transaction concurrency and locking and recovery.
        \n
        * [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/): TA for the introduction to computer science course. I wrote a lab that would teach some fundamentals of functional programming in a fun way, which was computing sentiments for restaurants using Apache Spark and the Yelp dataset. Collaborating with Databricks, we were able to create a lab that ~2000 students / semester used to learn core concepts like map and reduce in a fun yet practical manner.
        \n 
        * CS61B: Joined for the founding semester of Computer Science Mentors [(CSM)](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/) and mentored/tutored small groups of students for the data structures and algorithms course. During this semester, I wrote much of the material and handouts that were used to teach across all groups.
        \n
        *  EE40: Worked as a lab assistant for 2 semesters for the introduction to microelectronics course where it was often the first exposure many students had to hands on hardware. During labs, I taught the fundamentals of Analog HW such as filter, op-amps, etc and lab equipment such as signal generators, oscilloscopes, etc.
